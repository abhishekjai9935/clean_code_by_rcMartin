# Clean Code

## Introduction

After reading this book:

1. We will know lot about code
2. We'll be able to tell the difference between good code and bad code
3. We'll know how to write good code
4. We'll know how to transform bad code into good code.

## There will be code

- Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements.
We may create languages that are closer to the requirements. we may create tools that help us parse and assemble those requirements into formal structures.
But we will never eliminate necessary prescision- so there will always be code.


## Bad Code

- We all must have to go through bad code while our programming journey
- But we still write bad code and leave it for another day
- We generally decide that working mess is better than nothing
- Remember: **Later equals never**


## The Total Cost of Owning a Mess

- As the mess builds, the productivity of the team continues to decrease, asymptotically approaching zero.
- Every programmer have probably been slowed down by someone else's messy code or self messy code.
- In messy code, every change we make to the code breaks two or three other parts of the code.


## The Grand Redesign in the Sky

- Eventually the team rebels. They inform management that they cannot continue to develop in this odious code base. They demand a redesign.
- But redesigning the code and maintaining the old code, and sufficing the new requirements at the same time takes a lot of time.
During this long timespan, new codebase could also become messy. Then old team member starts leaving the organisation.
- So keeping code clean is not just cost effective; it's matter of professional survival.


## Attitude

We can say that following reasons are there to turn good code into bad code:

- We complain that the requirements changed in ways that thwart the original design.
- We bemoan the schedules that were too tight to do the things right
- We blather abotu stupid managers and intolerant customers and useless marketing types.

But fault is not in others but in ourselves. We are unprofessionals.

- We should not be shy about telling them what we think.
- Most managers want the truth, even when the don't act like it.
- They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that's their job.
- It's our job to defend the code with equal passion.

Conclusion:
- So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don't understand the risks of making messes.


## The Primal Conundrum

- The only waty to make the deadline - the only way to go fast - is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.
